# Epic 5 -- Task 5.1: Select and Integrate OCR Model Runtime for On-Device Inference

**Type:** `feature`

**Background:** The project has an existing OCR model. This task is to choose a suitable on-device inference engine (e.g., TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Mobile Runtime) and integrate it into the Android app to run this model. The choice should prioritize speed and ease of integration.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Research and select an appropriate mobile runtime for the existing OCR model. Document the decision.
*   The chosen runtime library is integrated into the Android app's build process.
*   The OCR model files are correctly packaged within the app (e.g., in assets).
*   A basic API is exposed in Kotlin/Java to load the model and prepare it for inference.
*   A placeholder function can pass dummy input to the model and receive dummy output, confirming the runtime is functional.

**Dependencies:** Task 1.1 (Build environment)

**Parallelizable?:** `yes` (can be started once runtime is chosen)

**Suggested Labels:** `android`, `ml`, `ocr`, `tflite`, `onnx`

**Effort Estimate:** M

**Definition of Done:** The selected OCR model runtime is integrated into the app, and the OCR model can be loaded successfully. Basic inference path is testable.
