# Epic 8 -- Task 8.1: Implement Python Unit Tests (pytest)

**Type:** `test`

**Background:** Core Python agent logic (e.g., specific modules, utility functions, non-Android dependent classes) should be unit tested to ensure correctness and prevent regressions. Pytest is a standard choice for Python testing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Pytest is added as a development dependency.
*   Unit tests are written for key Python modules/functions in the `Mobile-Agent-E` codebase.
*   Tests cover normal cases, edge cases, and error conditions.
*   Tests can be run with a simple command (e.g., `pytest`).
*   These tests are integrated into the CI workflow (Task 1.4) and must pass for the build to succeed.
*   Aim for reasonable coverage of new Python code developed for the agent.

**Dependencies:** Task 1.4 (CI integration)

**Parallelizable?:** `yes`

**Suggested Labels:** `python`, `test`, `pytest`, `ci`

**Effort Estimate:** L

**Definition of Done:** A suite of pytest unit tests for the Python agent code, integrated into and passing in the CI pipeline.
