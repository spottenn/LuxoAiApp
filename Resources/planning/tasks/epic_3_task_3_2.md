# Epic 3 -- Task 3.2: Create Foreground Service to Keep Agent Alive

**Type:** `feature`

**Background:** To allow the agent to operate for extended periods, even if the main app UI is backgrounded, a foreground service is necessary. This service will host the agent's main operational loop.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   A foreground service is implemented in the Android app.
*   The service starts when the "Start Agent" button (from Task 3.1) is pressed.
*   The service displays a persistent notification, as required by Android for foreground services.
*   The service can run a simple loop (e.g., logging a message every few seconds) even if the app's UI is sent to the background.
*   The service can be stopped (e.g., via a notification action or when the task is complete).

**Dependencies:** Task 3.1

**Parallelizable?:** `no` (depends on UI trigger)

**Suggested Labels:** `android`, `service`, `background-processing`

**Effort Estimate:** M

**Definition of Done:** A functional foreground service that starts on button press, shows a notification, and continues running when the app is backgrounded.
