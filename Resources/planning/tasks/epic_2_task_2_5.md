# Epic 2 -- Task 2.5: Audit & Correct Dependency Graph
*   **Type:** `chore`
*   **Background:**
    The `PLANNING_TASKS.md` file lists numerous tasks. This task is to perform a thorough review of all defined tasks to identify any unstated or missing dependencies between them. The goal is to ensure the dependency graph is as accurate as possible.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   All tasks in `PLANNING_TASKS.md` reviewed.
    *   Any discovered missing dependencies are explicitly added to the respective tasks' `Dependencies:` fields.
    *   The Mermaid dependency graph in `PLANNING_TASKS.md` is updated to reflect these corrections.
    *   A patch with these changes is committed.
*   **Dependencies:**
    `PLANNING_TASKS.md` populated and largely finalized.
*   **Parallelizable?:** `no`
*   **Suggested Labels:** `planning`, `dependencies`, `quality`
*   **Effort Estimate:** M
*   **Definition of Done:**
    Dependency graph corrected and updated.
