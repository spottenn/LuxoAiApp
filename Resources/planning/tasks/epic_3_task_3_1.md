# Epic 3 -- Task 3.1: Implement Minimal GUI with Text Field and 'Start Agent' Button

**Type:** `feature`

**Background:** The Minimum Viable Product for the Android app needs a basic user interface to receive a task instruction and a way to trigger the agent.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   App has a single screen.
*   Screen contains one text input field where the user can type a natural language task.
*   Screen contains one button labeled "Start Agent".
*   Pressing the button triggers a placeholder action (e.g., logs the input text). Actual agent invocation will be covered in later tasks.
*   UI is implemented using Jetpack Compose (preferred for modern Android development) or XML layouts. Justify if not Compose.

**Dependencies:** Task 1.1 (for build environment)

**Parallelizable?:** `yes`

**Suggested Labels:** `android`, `ui`, `mvp`, `jetpack-compose`

**Effort Estimate:** S

**Definition of Done:** An Android app with the described UI elements. The button click logs the text field content.
