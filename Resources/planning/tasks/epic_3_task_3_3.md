# Epic 3 -- Task 3.3: Integrate Accessibility Service for UI Interaction Simulation

**Type:** `feature`

**Background:** The agent needs to interact with other apps on the device. Android's Accessibility Services provide a robust way to inspect UI elements and simulate user actions like taps and text input, without needing root access.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   An Android Accessibility Service is implemented and configured in the app.
*   The app guides the user to enable the Accessibility Service in system settings.
*   The service can log basic information about the currently focused UI element (e.g., package name, class name, text content) when triggered.
*   The service can perform a simple action, like simulating a tap at specific screen coordinates or on a specific UI element (identified by its properties).
*   Clear explanation of why Accessibility Service is chosen over alternatives (e.g. UI Automator, which is more for testing).

**Dependencies:** Task 3.2 (service can host the interaction logic)

**Parallelizable?:** `no` (core to agent interaction)

**Suggested Labels:** `android`, `accessibility`, `ui-automation`

**Effort Estimate:** L

**Definition of Done:** A functional Accessibility Service that can inspect UI elements and simulate basic interactions, with a mechanism to guide the user through enabling it.
