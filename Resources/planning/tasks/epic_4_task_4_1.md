# Epic 4 -- Task 4.1: Hook Python Orchestrator into Android App via Chaquopy

**Type:** `feature`

**Background:** The existing Python agent orchestrator (`Mobile-Agent-E/run.py` or similar) needs to be callable from the Android app. Chaquopy, set up in Task 1.3, will be the bridge.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   The main Python agent script (or a defined entry point function within it) can be invoked from the Android foreground service (Task 3.2).
*   Basic initialization of the Python agent within the Android environment is successful.
*   Python agent can receive the task string entered in the Android UI (Task 3.1).
*   Python `print` statements or logging output from the agent are visible in Android's Logcat.
*   The existing Python code from `Mobile-Agent-E/MobileAgentE/` is correctly packaged by Chaquopy.

**Dependencies:** Task 1.3 (Chaquopy integration), Task 3.2 (Foreground Service)

**Parallelizable?:** `no` (critical path for agent functionality)

**Suggested Labels:** `android`, `python`, `chaquopy`, `integration`

**Effort Estimate:** L

**Definition of Done:** The Android app can successfully initialize and run the core Python agent orchestrator, passing it a task string from the UI. Python logs are visible in Logcat.
