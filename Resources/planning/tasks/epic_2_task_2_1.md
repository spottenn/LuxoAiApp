# Epic 2 -- Task 2.1: Auto-generate Architecture Diagram/README Section from Existing Code

**Type:** `docs`

**Background:** To help new developers (and agents) understand the existing codebase (Python agent and Android stub), we need a basic architectural overview. Automating parts of this documentation from the code structure can save time and ensure it stays somewhat up-to-date.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   A script (Python or other) is developed that scans the `Mobile-Agent-E/MobileAgentE/` Python directory and the `LuxoAI/app/src/main/` Android source directory.
*   The script identifies key modules/classes and their primary relationships (e.g., calls, inheritance).
*   Output is a Markdown section suitable for inclusion in a README, or a simple diagram (e.g., using PlantUML text format, or a Mermaid diagram).
*   The generated documentation provides a high-level overview of the main components and how they interact.
*   The script should be runnable on demand.

**Dependencies:** None (can be done early)

**Parallelizable?:** `yes`

**Suggested Labels:** `documentation`, `python`, `android`, `automation`

**Effort Estimate:** M

**Definition of Done:** A script that generates a useful architectural overview in Markdown or a text-based diagram format, committed to the repository. The main README should mention how to run this script.
