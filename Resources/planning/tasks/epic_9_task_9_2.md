*   It details how to use the `.env.example` file to create a local `.env` file.
*   It lists all required secret keys.
*   It briefly explains how secrets are loaded in the Android app and in GitHub Actions.

**Dependencies:** Task 1.5 (Secrets mechanism implemented)

**Suggested Labels:** `documentation`, `security`, `secrets`, `developer-ux`

**Effort Estimate:** S

**Definition of Done:** Clear documentation for setting up and using the secrets-injection mechanism.
