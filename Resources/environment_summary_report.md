Environment Summary Report

1.  CPU Information:
    *   Model: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Processor @ 2.30GHz (KVM Hypervisor)
    *   Cores: 4 cores, 1 thread per core (4 CPUs total)
    *   Architecture: x86_64
    *   BogoMIPS: ~4600
    *   Caches:
        *   L1d: 128 KiB (4 instances)
        *   L1i: 128 KiB (4 instances)
        *   L2: 1 MiB (4 instances)
        *   L3: 45 MiB (1 instance)
    *   Flags: Includes common instruction sets like SSE, AVX, AVX2.

2.  CPU Performance:
    *   Python Benchmark: Calculated Fibonacci(35) in approximately 2.28 seconds.
    *   stress-ng:
        *   Ran `stress-ng --cpu 1 --cpu-ops 100000 --metrics-brief`.
        *   Achieved ~1129 bogo ops/s (real time).
        *   The test completed in approximately 88.57 seconds.

3.  Memory Information:
    *   Total Physical Memory: Approximately 7.8 GiB (8150140 kB from /proc/meminfo).
    *   Available Memory (at time of check): Approximately 7.4 GiB (from free -h).
    *   Swap: 0B (No swap space configured).
    *   Memory Allocation Limit Test (Python):
        *   The script successfully allocated memory in 100MB chunks.
        *   It reached 7700MB (7.52GB) of allocated memory before the process was presumably terminated by the OS OOM (Out Of Memory) killer. The log ends abruptly after this allocation.
        *   This suggests the practical memory limit for a single user process is around 7.5GB.

4.  Storage Information:
    *   Primary Filesystem (/dev/vdb mounted on /rom/overlay and / via overlayfs):
        *   Size: 9.8G
        *   Used: ~609M
        *   Available: ~8.7G
        *   Use%: 7%
    *   tmpfs partitions: Various tmpfs partitions exist (e.g., /dev/shm, /run), with the largest being /dev/shm at 3.9G.
    *   I/O Performance:
        *   Sequential Write Speed: Approximately 412 MB/s (tested with `dd if=/dev/zero of=test_write_file.tmp bs=1M count=1024 oflag=direct`).
        *   Sequential Read Speed: Approximately 631 MB/s (tested with `dd if=test_write_file.tmp of=/dev/null bs=1M iflag=direct`).
    *   File Creation Limits:
        *   A test script successfully created 654,984 empty files in a single directory before failing.
        *   The failure mode was "Errno 28: No space left on device", indicating the limit was due to exhaustion of available disk space by the files themselves, rather than an inode limit or a specific limit on the number of files per directory.

5.  Process and Thread Limits:
    *   Thread Limit: A Python script successfully created 9,544 threads before failing with a "can't start new thread" error.
    *   Process Limit: The same Python script, when attempting to create processes *after* the thread test, failed to create any new processes, erroring with "[Errno 11] Resource temporarily unavailable". This is likely due to resource pressure from the extensive thread creation immediately prior. A precise standalone process limit would require testing in an isolated environment.

Breakdown Points & Limitations:

*   Memory: Processes are likely to be killed if they attempt to allocate significantly more than ~7.5GB of memory.
*   Process Creation (under load): Creating a large number of threads (e.g., >9000) can exhaust resources to the point that new process creation fails. The standalone process creation limit was not determined in an isolated test.
*   Tooling for Shell/Script Execution (Historical Note): While previous attempts to use `run_in_bash_session` for script execution and I/O tests failed, the tool was functional during the latest round of tests for `dd` and Python script execution. This suggests previous issues might have been transient or environment-specific at that time.

Summary of Identifiable Virtual Hardware & Limits:

*   CPU: 4-core Intel Xeon @ 2.30GHz (virtualized by KVM).
*   Memory: ~7.8 GiB total, with ~7.5 GiB usable by a single process before OOM kill.
*   Storage:
    *   ~9.8 GiB available on the primary partition.
    *   Sequential Write Speed: ~412 MB/s.
    *   Sequential Read Speed: ~631 MB/s.
    *   File Creation: Limited by available disk space; successfully created >650,000 small files before disk exhaustion.
*   Process/Thread Limits:
    *   Thread Limit: Approximately 9,544 threads per process.
    *   Process Limit: At least 0 when system resources are heavily utilized by prior thread creation. The absolute limit under normal conditions was not isolated.
