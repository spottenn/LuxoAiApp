Environment Summary Report

1.  CPU Information:
    *   Model: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Processor @ 2.30GHz (KVM Hypervisor)
    *   Cores: 4 cores, 1 thread per core (4 CPUs total)
    *   Architecture: x86_64
    *   BogoMIPS: ~4600
    *   Caches:
        *   L1d: 128 KiB (4 instances)
        *   L1i: 128 KiB (4 instances)
        *   L2: 1 MiB (4 instances)
        *   L3: 45 MiB (1 instance)
    *   Flags: Includes common instruction sets like SSE, AVX, AVX2.

2.  CPU Performance:
    *   Python Benchmark: Calculated Fibonacci(35) in approximately 2.28 seconds.
    *   stress-ng:
        *   Ran `stress-ng --cpu 1 --cpu-ops 100000 --metrics-brief`.
        *   Achieved ~1129 bogo ops/s (real time).
        *   The test completed in approximately 88.57 seconds.

3.  Memory Information:
    *   Total Physical Memory: Approximately 7.8 GiB (8150140 kB from /proc/meminfo).
    *   Available Memory (at time of check): Approximately 7.4 GiB (from free -h).
    *   Swap: 0B (No swap space configured).
    *   Memory Allocation Limit Test (Python):
        *   The script successfully allocated memory in 100MB chunks.
        *   It reached 7700MB (7.52GB) of allocated memory before the process was presumably terminated by the OS OOM (Out Of Memory) killer. The log ends abruptly after this allocation.
        *   This suggests the practical memory limit for a single user process is around 7.5GB.

4.  Storage Information:
    *   Primary Filesystem (/dev/vdb mounted on /rom/overlay and / via overlayfs):
        *   Size: 9.8G
        *   Used: ~609M
        *   Available: ~8.7G
        *   Use%: 7%
    *   tmpfs partitions: Various tmpfs partitions exist (e.g., /dev/shm, /run), with the largest being /dev/shm at 3.9G.
    *   I/O Performance & File Creation Limits:
        *   NOT TESTED: Attempts to test I/O performance (read/write speeds using `dd` or Python) and file creation limits (number of files in a directory) failed repeatedly.
        *   Reason: Persistent "Internal error occurred when running command" errors from the `run_in_bash_session` tool when trying to execute shell scripts, Python scripts, or even basic commands involving file I/O or redirection.

5.  Process and Thread Limits:
    *   NOT TESTED: Attempts to test process and thread creation limits using a Python script failed.
    *   Reason: The Python script (proc_thread_test.py) was created, but could not be executed due to the same "Internal error occurred when running command" from the `run_in_bash_session` tool. Empirical limits could not be determined.

Breakdown Points & Limitations:

*   Memory: Processes are likely to be killed if they attempt to allocate significantly more than ~7.5GB of memory.
*   Tooling for Shell/Script Execution: The primary limitation encountered was the instability of the `run_in_bash_session` tool. It consistently failed with tasks involving:
    *   File redirection (e.g., > output.txt, 2>&1).
    *   Execution of shell scripts.
    *   Execution of Python scripts.
        This prevented direct measurement of storage I/O performance, file creation limits, and process/thread limits.
*   Storage I/O: While disk space is known, actual throughput (MB/s read/write) or IOPS could not be measured. Performance under heavy I/O load is unknown.
*   File Creation: The maximum number of files or inodes could not be tested.

Summary of Identifiable Virtual Hardware & Limits:

*   CPU: 4-core Intel Xeon @ 2.30GHz (virtualized by KVM).
*   Memory: ~7.8 GiB total, with ~7.5 GiB usable by a single process before OOM kill.
*   Storage: ~9.8 GiB available on the primary partition. Specific I/O performance and file count limits are unknown due to tool failures.
*   Process/Thread Limits: Unknown due to tool failures.
